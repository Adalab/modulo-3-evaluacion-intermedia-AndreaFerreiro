# MODULE 3 | Individual project: Friends Phrases

## Summary
I have been asked to create a website where the users can see some phrases which were used by the characters of the TV show named Friends.

## How it works

All the Phrases are inside a API but, once the user open de website, the localStorage keep all the information.
-In the top of the page, there is a form witch is used for search by phrase or character how said it.
-At the bottom, ther is another form, but, this one is for add new phrases. 
-In case of add a new phrase, the localStorage will keep it with the others so, even if the user restart the website, all yhe phrases will appear.
